# News App

### [Link to App](https://onurbuldukoglu.github.io/News-App/)
---
This is a responsive news application that should serve the user news on either keywords they searched for or the category they choose. Not fully functional due to API problems, to be fixed. App working in local environment can be seen [here](https://streamable.com/eziw4a).

The app is created with create-react-app. As an opportunity for learning and practice, Sass is used as the CSS preprocessor.

All the React components were created as functional components. To be able to use React state and lifecycle methods, useState and useEffect hooks, respectively, were used. For typechecking component props, React's built-in typechecking ability PropTypes were used. 

Various npm packages were used to achieve specific goals, such as [react-masonry-css](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-masonry-css) package for masonry look for the news cards on the feed and [react-intersection-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-intersection-observer) for checking if an element is in viewport.
